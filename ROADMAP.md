Acacia
======

Acacia is focused on using unique identifiers to harvest metadata and import into our institutional repository. The initial version is focused on DOI import.  Eventually it will include other sources of metadata.

In this version our Institutional repository is assumed to be EPrints 3.3.16. Longer run support for InvenioRDM will be added as we're planning to migrate to that IR in the future.

Blue Cloud ideas
----------------

1. Look up someone via [orcid](https://orcid.org) and harvest their public bilographic data
2. Look up record in PubMed (or similar currated system with an API) and retrieve bibliographic records and objects (e.g. PDFs)
3. Automate digital object retrieval and import (e.g. retrieve PDFs and import along side the metadata)
