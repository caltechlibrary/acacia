=============================

The [vector artwork](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=acacia&i=1586856) of an [acacia tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acacia) use as part of the logo for this repository was created by [Kelsey Armstrong](https://thenounproject.com/kelseyarmstrongcreative/) from the Noun Project.  It is licensed under the Creative Commons [CC-BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.

The logo was slightly edited in [Boxy SVG](https://boxy-svg.com), a native SVG editor for macOS, to change the color to the orange used by Caltech in the institute logo, and to slightly modify the bottom shape of the logo.
