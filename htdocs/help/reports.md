Available Reports
=================

Two reports are currently provided via Acacia's web application.

2. Message Report 
1. DOI Report

Message Report
--------------

The purpose of the message report is to show which messages Acacia
knows about. The retrieval of email from the [submissions.authors@library.caltech.edu](email:submissions.authors@library.caltech.edu) account is
done automatically through the day. This report shows what messages
have been retrieved and on what day they were retrieved. It also
includes a column "Processed". If you see a ✔️ in the column that means
the message was processed and any DOI found have been extracted and
placed into the DOI Report.


DOI Report
----------

The DOI Report shows the DOI that Acacia knows about and the status
of processing that DOI. A number steps are done before the DOI is
"ready" for generating EPrints XML.  If the status is shown as
"ready" you can select the DOI for export.  Links to both the DOI
URL and any provided Digital Object is included.  Note that for
most publishers you need to be "on Caltech Network" to have access.
If you are working off campus you can use the [VPN]() to route
all your interenet traffic through campus. This should allow you
to retrieve any digital objects identified explicitly by URL.

After reviewing the DOI and retrieving the desired digital object
to your local machine you can check the "export" checkbox. When your
ready to export then you can press the "export doi" button and an
EPrints XML will be generated you can download.  NOTE: when you
generate the EPrints XML it sets the name of the "export bundle"
when you refresh the DOI report page. This way you can easily
retieve the EPrints XML later or know that it is ready for export.

If the DOI record is importing successfully into EPrints the column
with the EPrints ID should populate with a link to authors.library.caltech.edu. Those records do not need to be exported again. You can 
curate them directly in eprints.
