Export to EPrints
=================

Acacia can generate EPrints XML which you can then save and import into EPrints (e.g. CaltechAUTHORS). Go to [Manage DOI](/list) and select the
items you wish to generate EPrints XML for, then click the [Generate Export] button on the page. This will cause EPrints XML to be generated for the elected items.  This will be presented as a link in the page. Download the link's content. If everything went OK then you can click "Export Completed" button, otherwise if you are not happy with your selection you can click "Discard Export" button.
