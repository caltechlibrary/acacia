Retrieving Metadata from CrossRef and DataCite
==============================================

On the [DOI Report](../list) each unprocessed DOI listed includes
a button on the left that is labeled "Look up". If you press this
button the CrossRef and DataCite websites will be contacted and
any available metadata found for that DOI will be collected. This
metadata is used to generate the EPrints XML needed to import
a DOI into CaltechAUTHORS.

If the DOI listed has been processed you will see a "reset" button.
This will clear the retrieved data from our DOI collection.
