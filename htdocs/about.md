Welcome to ACACIA
=================

Acacia is a micro service for processing [DOI]() submission requests for
[CaltechAUTHORS](https://authors.library.caltech.edu). It is based on 
an Email submission of a DOI and a link to a PDF. Acacia allows you to
manage the incoming DOI submissions and generate EPrint XML that can
be used to generate EPrints records using EPrint XML import
functionality.
