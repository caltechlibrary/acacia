Welcome to Acacia
=================

Acacia is an ingest tool for metadata (e.g. [DOI](https://doi.org)) into an institutional repository record. Our institutional repository is [CaltechAUTHORS](https://authors.library.caltech.edu) currently implemented using [EPrints](https://eprints.org).

Presently DOI can be emailed to [submissions.authors@library.caltech.edu](mailto:submissions.authors@library.caltech.edu) or added individually using the "[Add a DOI](./add-doi)" link above.

The [DOI](https://doi.org) metadata is retrieved from either CrossRef and DataCite. The collected DOI are checked against our existing repository data (e.g. [CaltechAUTHORS](https://authors.library.caltech.edu)). If not previously imported then metadata can be retrieved from [CrossRef](https://crossref.org) or [DataCite](https://datacite.org) with a click of the "look up" button. If the metadata is acceptable you can then click "Import" to import the metadata collected into our IR.
